To import a DaZeus legacy module, just copy it here. Then, replace all
instances of "Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module" to "DaZeus2Module". For
example, open the file in vim, then type these two commands (with ENTER in
between):

  :%s/Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module/DaZeus2Module/g
  :wq

The last command will save and close the file. You should now be able to use
the module.

Warning: The API is not 100% complete. You may need to change your module a
little bit to make it work. If there are serious holes in the current legacy
API implementation, let me know.
